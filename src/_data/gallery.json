        "notes": "Steel art. Tall, noticeable from any place in Paris, landmark and significant icon of the city. This Paris sunset holds a particular place in my travel voyages. Stitched strong to my memories, the sunset I witnessed sitting across the lawn in front of the tower, having few cold ones, beats any of my southern californian sunsets.",

        "notes": "One of the few authentic farmer's markets in the United States. This is a working market that doubles as a tourist attraction. It is filled with food and flower stalls. I particularly enjoyed seeing the catch of the day, given that I don't live in the Pacific NW. It also has artisans who ply their trade right in front of you. Note that I call this a 'working marketing' before I alluded to it being a place tourists might enjoy. Pike had a nice blend of 'real' and 'attraction'",
