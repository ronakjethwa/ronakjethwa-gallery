        "notes": "Steel art. Tall, noticeable from any place in Paris, landmark and significant icon of the city. This Paris sunset holds a particular place in my travel voyages. Stitched strong to my memories, the sunset I witnessed sitting across the lawn in front of the tower, having few cold ones, beats any of my southern californian sunsets.",

I particularly enjoyed seeing the catch of the day, given that I don't live in the Pacific NW. It also has artisans who ply their trade right in front of you. Note that I call this a 'working marketing' before I alluded to it being a place tourists might enjoy. Pike had a nice blend of 'real' and 'attraction'",

        "notes": "The Original Starbucks, located near the waterfront in Seattle’s Pike Place Market, isn’t the modest 45-year-old sign. This Starbucks is were it all began. The line may be crazy long, the coffee is the same as any other Starbucks, you go there for the experience. It is a neat experience to hear the history of the company and order a drink from the very first Starbucks.",

The neighborhood is quite wealthy and there are some beautiful homes in the area. One of the best places to stroll around on the regular Seattle evenings.",
