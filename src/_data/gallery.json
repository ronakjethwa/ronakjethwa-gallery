Stitched strong to my memories, the sunset I witnessed sitting across the lawn in front of the tower, having few cold ones, beats any of my southern californian sunsets.",

Note that I call this a 'working marketing' before I alluded to it being a place tourists might enjoy. Pike had a nice blend of 'real' and 'attraction'",

The line may be crazy long, the coffee is the same as any other Starbucks, you go there for the experience. It is a neat experience to hear the history of the company and order a drink from the very first Starbucks.",

Glad that picture turned out to be a good one in the end.",
